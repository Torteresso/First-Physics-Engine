PRESENTATION
============

My first try to make small physics engine in c++ using SMFL.

Current state : 

- drawing about 18 000 circles at 60 FPS with collisions and verlet physics (optimized with a grid, no multithreading)

HOW TO USE IT
=============

If you want to test it, you should download:  

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

And then you can clone it in Visual Studio Community 2022.
